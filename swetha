# Epileptic Classification with Deep Transfer Learning

This project focuses on the classification of brain tumors using MRI scans, leveraging deep learning and traditional machine learning classifiers for accurate detection.

## 🧠 Project Summary

The human brain plays a critical role in body function. Tumors that originate in brain tissue can be fatal if not diagnosed early. This project explores a deep-transfer-learning-based feature fusion approach to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images using a CNN pipeline.

## 📌 Highlights

- Used **Adaptive Bilateral Filter** for MRI image noise removal.
- Performed **segmentation using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.
- Applied **binary thresholding** for enhanced tumor region extraction.
- Compared multiple classifiers:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Random Forest
  - Naive Bayes
  - Proposed Transfer Learning Fusion Model
